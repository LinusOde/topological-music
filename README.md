# Topological Music: Turning Number Sequences Into Sound

**Authors**: Hugo Angulo & Linus Ode  
**Status**: Work-in-progress experimental platform  
**Started**: July 2025

## ✨ Project Summary

We explore how number sequences (like those from OEIS) can be interpreted musically using topological mappings. Our goal is to discover new ways to hear structure, logic, and abstraction — revealing patterns that are not always visible, but may become audible.

## 👥 Credits

This project was initiated by Hugo Angulo, who first proposed the idea of exploring number sequences through musical and topological mappings.  
Special thanks to the OEIS community and the open-source we build upon.

## 🎯 Goals

- Map number sequences to musical structures (pitch, rhythm, harmony)
- Explore spatial/topological models (e.g. circle, torus, Möbius)
- Create code tools for sequence-to-audio translation
- Investigate perceptual qualities of mathematical music

## 🛠️ Code + Audio Demos

Check the [`code/`](./code) folder for working scripts.  
Example: `prototype1.js` plays a number sequence as a melody.  
Check [`sound_tests/`](./sound_tests) to hear results.

## 📚 Ongoing Research Topics

- Sequence topology and musical space
- Auditory perception of math structure
- Algorithmic composition vs. intuitive listening
