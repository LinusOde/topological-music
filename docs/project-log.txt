**Project Log: Topological Music**

**Start Date**: July 2025  
**Participants**: [User], Hugo Angulo  
**Platform**: GitHub (public), MuseScore, Python (planned), possible use of MusicXML and sound rendering tools

### **Entry 1: Project Initialization**

**Date**: July 17, 2025

- Created a GitHub repository for the project with an MIT license.
- Confirmed with Hugo that the project could move forward publicly.
- A short project description was written: *"Exploring music from number sequences using topology, code, and perception to reveal hidden structures through sound."*
- Intention stated to respect Hugo's conceptual ownership, especially if earlier work was to be kept private.

### **Entry 2: Tooling and Software**

**Date**: July 17, 2025

- Chose **MuseScore** as the free, open-source notation and playback tool. It replaces the need for Dorico and NotePerformer, which are paid.
- Created a local folder structure compatible with GitHub:
  - `code/` for scripts
  - `docs/` for writeups and theory
  - `sound_tests/` for exported audio

### **Entry 3: Conceptual Grounding**

**Date**: July 17, 2025

- Discussed with Hugo how increasing numerical values in sequences might be perceived sonically as a change in spatial experience:
  - Smaller numbers = "dry," "infant-like," muted audio.
  - Larger numbers = more spacious, echo-rich, expanded sound field.
  - Idea: audio lives in a virtual room whose size changes with the data.
- This inspired the idea to map number sequences to **reverb**, **timbre**, and **spatialization** â€” not just pitch and rhythm.

### **Entry 4: Research Into Auditory Perception**

**Date**: July 17, 2025

- Investigated how the human brain perceives musical structure:
  - **Gestalt principles**: grouping, symmetry, repetition.
  - **Auditory Scene Analysis**: layering of sounds.
  - **1/f rhythm patterns**: preferred by the brain.
  - **Emotional response** to musical expectation and resolution.
- Conclusions:
  - Structure in number sequences must be made perceptible through auditory features that the brain naturally responds to.
  - This validates the project's core idea: number-based structures can be "heard" if thoughtfully rendered.

### **Planned Next Steps**

- Write a Python script that converts OEIS sequences to MusicXML.
- Use MuseScore to import, visualize, and play these sequences.
- Experiment with mapping number properties (size, gaps, modularity) to musical parameters (pitch, rhythm, space, timbre).
- Log further conceptual conversations and findings in `docs/` folder of the repo.
