# Audio as Mathematical Perception

This document explores the connection between number, pattern, and sound — investigating how mathematical sequences become musical experiences.

## 1. Why Hear Math?

While math is often visual (graphs, symbols), hearing opens up a new form of perception — especially for temporal and structural patterns. This project asks:

- Can mathematical structure *feel* musical?
- What makes a numeric sequence *audible* as logic or pattern?
- Can topological ideas (twists, loops, holes) be heard?

## 2. Existing Practices

- **Pythagorean Harmony**: Ratios like 2:1 and 3:2 map to musical intervals
- **Sonification**: Turning data into sound (e.g., primes, DNA, weather)
- **Algorithmic Composition**: Math rules to generate form
- **Perception Research**: Human brain detects patterns in rhythm, symmetry, grouping

## 3. Directions for This Project

- Use OEIS sequences as audio input
- Explore different mappings (pitch, rhythm, spatialization)
- Study how listeners perceive “meaning” in abstract number-driven music
- Design topological transformations of musical space
